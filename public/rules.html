      <h4>Who is this game for?</h4>
      <p>Anyone who learns or speaks Japanese. If you are just beginning to learn Japanese and not comfortable with Kanji then Kana mode is for you.
        If you feel confident enough - try to outsmart AI by playing Kanji! And even if you are a native speaker you might
        find it challenging because players have a limited time to make a guess.
      </p>  
      <h4>Two ways to play</h4>
      <p>All players automatically join the lobby where they can specify the difficulty and mode
         they want to play and send a game request to other player. Invite your friends and have an online battle!
        If you don't feel like it - play against AI to learn just how long you can stand with your current knowledge. Whenever you
        fail, you can investigate the meaning of the word you didn't know and try again!
      </p>

    <legend><strong>General rules</strong></legend>
      <h4>Game flow</h4>
      <p>The basic rule is to simply start your word with a character (either Kana or Kanji) that is identical to the last
        character of your opponent's word. You (and your opponent) can only use a certain word once per game.
      </p>
      <h4>Time limit (difficulty)</h4>
      <p>
        Amount of time per turn is limited. Each mode comes with 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal and Hard.
        In <strong>Easy</strong> you have 50 seconds to say a word. In <strong>Normal</strong> it is 25 seconds and in <strong>Hard</strong>
        you only have 10 seconds. The orange bar at the top of the screen is the time indicator and is shown during a game.
      </p>
      <h4>Dictionary check</h4>
      <p>Every time you send a word, the game uses a dictionary to check whether it is a real word. If your word does not exist
        you have to enter a new one in time.
      </p>

    <legend><strong>Kana mode</strong></legend>
      <h4>Words that you cannot use:</h4>
      <p>Words that end with ん or ン. This is because there are no words in Japanese that start with ん or ン. Traditionally, 
        the player who says such a word loses, but in this online version you will be asked to enter another word instead.
      </p>
      <h4>Normalization</h4>
      <p>Sometimes you or your opponent will use words that end with long sound symbol "ー" or small kana (ゃ / ょ / ゅ). The long sound symbol
        is ignored and the character that precedes is used instead. Small kana gets "capitalized" by the program so it is OK to say e.g. ゆめ after
        your opponent says にほんしゅ.
      </p>

    <legend><strong>Kanji mode</strong></legend>
      <h4>Words that you cannot use:</h4>
      <p>Unlike Kana mode, you CAN use words which end with ん or ン when pronounced. It simply does not matter because it is the written
        character that must be matched in this mode.</p>
      <h4>Win conditions</h4>
      <p>Again, unlike with Kana, the number of Kanji words that start with a certain character may be very limited. This means that 
        if you are playing against AI you can actually win because AI can't find a word.</p>
