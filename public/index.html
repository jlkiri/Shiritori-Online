          <h4>Welcome to Shiritori!</h4>
          <p>Shiritori (しりとり) is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say 
            a word which begins with the final character of the previous word.</p>
          <p>Originally, no distinction
          is made between Kana and Kanji since words are spoken by players. In this digital version,
          you are welcome to experience Shiritori in either Kana or Kanji as distinct modes. </p>
